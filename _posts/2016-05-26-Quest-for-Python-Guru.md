title: Quest for Python Guru status
---
**Seeking Python Guru status.**
 
  Today I decided to become a volunteer for the [openstack-nova](http://www.openstack.org/) project. I like to consider myself a good Python programmer. However, I've mostly
been utilising my skills within the sysadmin and Devops realm. I want to expand from this realm and become a 'Guru' in python if there's anything like that.
I looked for different python projects to contribute to. I ended up with [twisted matrix](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/) and openstack, my personal preference made me choose openstack nova. I like the code structure in openstack and also feel that cloud computing i something that has and will continue to disrupt the IT field. I want to be a part of this.
 **Contributing to Openstack:**
   There's many ways to contribute, for more information visit: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/How_To_Contribute

  I chose the Developer option, cloned the Nova repository and I'm now working on bugs, focusing on the low-hanging fruits to be precise. I will provide updates during this interesting and adventorous journey.

Thanks,
